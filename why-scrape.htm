            <h1>Why Scrape Websites?</h1>
            <p>
                Websites often have information that is useful for other purposes. Some websites, such as stock exchanges, may even have useful financial data that a clever programmer could put to good use in a private system to try and beat the market as a day trader, or to identify trends.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you find a website with a lot of data that is organized in a way that is inconvenient, you can use a scraper to extract that information and automatically put it in a more convenient format. This can be a very useful skill to have, and can relatively easily be repurposed from one site to the next for a variety of uses once you get the hang of it. Instead of taking days or weeks of labor manually moving numbers around, it can take just a few minutes of coding, followed by some time of doing whatever else you want while you wait for the script to load. It can free up a lot of time that might otherwise be spent on very tedious, repetitive tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, maybe you find a website that updates frequently and you want to gather that data into some sort of collection, as with the stock exchange example. If you want to keep a running list of all stock exchanges that have happened since a certain day/time, scraping that data could be one way to make your task feasible. Of course, scraping the stock exchange may be a poor example since APIs might exist that simplify this for you, but the possibilities extend well beyond this. Maybe you want to catalog every article about X topic that a news company posts. Maybe you want to gather every new change log from Mojang's website as they put out new snapshots/releases.
